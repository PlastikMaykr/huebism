# Huebism

Huebism is a HSL color space exploration and palette creation tool featuring an interactive 3D palette viewing cube. It is intended for designers and coders to experiment with colors and create custom palettes.


## Features

- **Interactive 3D Palette Cube**: Visualize colors dots in a 3D space where coordinates are map to *Hue*, *Saturation*, and *Lightness*.
- **Adjustable Hue Range**: Sliders allow you to adjust the hue range so you can focus on specific colors.
- **Color Selection**: Click on any dot to select its color and view detailed properties, including HSL, RGB, and Hex codes.
- **Predefined Palettes**: Explore palettes sourced from Wikipedia colors, CSS named colors, Coolors, and more.
- **Custom Palettes**: Create, save, and manage your own custom palettes. Selected palettes are serialized and saved in localStorage.
- **Color Interpolation**: Interpolate between two neighboring colors with customizable easing functions for each HSL property.
